This is the directory where you will work on building our UI for Optipy.

This UI will send/receive Requests from our backend flask server.
  - Make sure to handle all the necessary routes to receive all the information for the UI.

As a recap, we will use React Vite for our Frontend.
  - You may refer to the IT Client folder for any Inspiration on the UI.

For any concerns, feel free to message our groupchat.
